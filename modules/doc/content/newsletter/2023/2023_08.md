## MOOSE Improvements

### Functor Neumann boundary condition

[FunctorNeumannBC.md] was added, which implements a Neumann boundary condition
with an imposed [functor](Functors/index.md) and optional functor coefficient.

### Cylindrical gap heat flux functor material

[CylindricalGapHeatFluxFunctorMaterial.md] was added to compute the heat flux
across a cylindrical gap, based on the surface radii, temperatures, and emissivities,
as well as the gap thermal conductivity, all provided via [functors](Functors/index.md). Note that this
approach differs from existing approaches in the [heat conduction module](modules/heat_conduction/index.md)
due to having the gap distance be based on user input rather than mesh information.
This makes it ideal for situations in which one of the surfaces is 2D, or if
thermal expansion is provided as a direct user model instead of having the mesh
be deformable. Additionally, the use of functors makes this model very flexible.
